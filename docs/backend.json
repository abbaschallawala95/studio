It prioritizes authorization independence and supports necessary CRUD operations. All charging session data is stored under the respective user's document, ensuring that only the user can access their data. This design avoids complex hierarchical permissions or the need for `get()` calls in security rules.\n\n- Authorization Independence: Achieved by storing each charging session directly under the user's document, eliminating the need to check parent document permissions.\n\n- QAPs Support: Segregation is achieved by nesting all charging sessions under the `/users/{userId}/charging_sessions/{sessionId}` path. This ensures that list operations can be securely performed, as rules can simply check if the requesting user's ID matches the `userId` parameter in the path."
