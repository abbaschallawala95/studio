/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for eScotty Tracker - Prototyping Mode
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for charging sessions. Each user can only access their own charging session data. The rules are designed for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization while relaxing data shape validation.
 * @dataStructure All charging session data is nested under /users/{userId}/charging_sessions/{sessionId}.
 * @keySecurityDecisions User listing is disallowed. Write rules are restricted to the owner of the data. Data shape validation is minimal.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization N/A - Path-based ownership eliminates the need for denormalization.
